## Installation

### Binaries

A precompiled plugin for QtCreator Windows with statically linked
editorconfig-core-c and pcre can be found
[here](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-qtcreator/releases/latest).
It has to be unpacked into the Qt folder (Usually `C:\Qt`).

RPMs for openSUSE Leap 42.1 and Tumbleweed are available from the
[openSUSE Build Service](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hgraeber:/Qt5/).

### From Source

Requirements:

- QtCreator source and build folders
- editorconfig-core-c
- pcre

The last two are best taken from your linux distribution. For Windows they
usually must be build locally and added to the `INCLUDEPATH` and `LIBS`
variables. Static editorconfig-core-c and pcre libraries are best for easy
deployment of the plugin.

For building plugins you usually have to build QtCreator yourself. For
openSUSE the special libqt5-creator-plusgin-devel RPM provided in the
repository mentioned above can be used instead.

The environment variables `QTC_SOURCE` shall contain the path to qt-creators
source, `QTC_BUILD` to it's build folder. Now run

    mkdir build
    cd  build
    qmake ../editorconfig.pro
    make
    make install

Instead of using the environment variables you can specify `QTCREATOR_SOURCES`
and `IDE_BUILD_TREE` on the qmake command line.

Additionally you can specify `USE_USER_DESTDIR=yes`, so that the plugin is
installed in the users plugin folder for direct use with the next run of
QtCreator. QtCreator option `-noload EditorConfig` can be used to suppress
the load of the plugin, for the case that something goes wrong.

## Supported Properties

The EditorConfig QtCreator plugin supports the following EditorConfig properties:

- charset
- indent_style
- indent_size
- tab_width
- trim_trailing_whitespace
- insert_final_newline

## Additonal Features

Initial EditorConfig files may be created using the new file wizard. The initial
values for this file are taken from the current projects C++ and Qml settings.
